Predictive Maintenance for Wind Turbines
1. Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict wind turbine failures early so that operators can schedule maintenance and avoid unexpected breakdowns.

Minimize false alarms (false positives) to reduce unnecessary interventions.

Provide actionable interpretation of predictions for wind farm operators.

2. Data Analysis & Feature Selection
Steps:

Load the SCADA dataset containing timestamps, turbine IDs, sensor readings, and event logs.

Inspect data: check columns, data types, missing values, and outliers.

Identify failure events using event/alarm logs.

Create target labels:

label = 1 → failure occurs within next 24 hours

label = 0 → normal operation

Feature Engineering:

Physical features: rotor speed, nacelle temperature, gearbox temperature, blade pitch, wind speed, active power.

Temporal features: rolling means and standard deviations (1h, 6h, 24h windows).

Delta features: deviation from rolling averages.

Handle missing data: forward-fill per turbine, fill remaining gaps using median values.

Scale features (if required) for models like neural networks or distance-based methods.

3. Supervised Learning Approach
Steps:

Data splitting:

Training data → earlier timestamps

Testing data → later timestamps (avoid leakage)

Model training:

Use Random Forest or XGBoost classifier with engineered features.

Handle class imbalance:

Use class_weight='balanced' or scale_pos_weight.

Threshold tuning:

Adjust probability threshold to reduce false positives while maintaining recall.

Evaluation metrics:

Precision, Recall, F1-score

False Alarm Rate (FAR = FP / (FP + TN))

Lead time (hours before failure)

Model interpretation:

High precision → fewer false alarms

Feature importance → actionable insights

4. Unsupervised / Anomaly Detection Approach
Steps:

Train on normal data only:

Use Isolation Forest or Autoencoder to learn normal operating behavior.

Detect anomalies:

Identify unusual sensor readings indicating potential failure.

Evaluate using same metrics as supervised approach.

Compare with supervised results:

Unsupervised models detect unknown failure patterns

Typically lower precision/recall but complementary to supervised learning

5. Evaluation & Comparison

Key Metrics:

Precision: minimize false alarms

Recall: detect as many failures as possible

F1-score: balance between precision and recall

False Alarm Rate (FAR)

Lead Time: how early the failure is detected

Comparison:

Supervised → higher precision (better for reliable alerts)

Unsupervised → detect novel failures (good as a backup system)

Hybrid approach → best coverage

6. Recommendations

Primary model: Supervised learning (Random Forest/XGBoost) with threshold tuning for high precision.

Backup system: Unsupervised anomaly detection for unknown failure modes.

Operational deployment:

Run predictions hourly or daily.

Output: turbine ID, failure lead time, top contributing features.

Future improvements:

Add vibration or extra sensor data.

Use sequence models (LSTM/Transformer) for better temporal pattern recognition.

Improve feature engineering to extend early warning lead time.

7. Conclusion

Supervised learning delivers interpretable and precise early failure warnings.

Unsupervised models add resilience by catching new or rare failure patterns.

Combining both minimizes downtime, optimizes maintenance scheduling, and reduces operational costs.
